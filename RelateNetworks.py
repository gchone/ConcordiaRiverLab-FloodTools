"""This tool creates a 'near table' to relate river routes('A') and D8/D4 routes ('B').
When it runs once, some links are omitted and others in_features are linked to two different reaches from the near_feature layer.
This issue is related to the way ArcGis calculates distance in proximity tools such as "Near Table"
- Multiple features may be equally closest to another feature. When this occurs, one of the equally closest features is randomly selected as the closest.
- The distance between two features is zero whenever there is at least one x,y coordinate that is shared between them.
- This means that when two features intersect, overlap, cross, or touch, the distance between them is zero.
For fixing this issue, the tool has to run twice (A to B and B to A). Then 2 clean-ups are required:
1. Clean up of duplicate combinations
2. Clean up wrong combination based on the number of intersections (points) between the two layers"""
